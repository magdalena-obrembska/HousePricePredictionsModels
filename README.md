# HousePricePredictionsModels
Models to predict  house sale prices - Kaggle competition.

Project includes: Data preproccesing and describe. Dealing with missing data (fill missing values by documentation when NA means something else than NA. KNN Imputer for real missing data. Dealing with skewness(numeric features with log method), kurtosis to visualize that outliers in plot there are not always useless outliers. Standard Scaler. (Maybe I should use Robust Scaler) New features added. Split and create new dataframe(with added new features). Models -Linear Regression -HistGradientBoostingRegressor -AdaBoostRegressor -CatBoostRegressor -SVR(linear) - commented -XGBRegressor -Random Forest Regressor -Gradient Boosting Regressor -Voting Regressor  Hyperparameters tuning (in some cases create function to find best params, in some cases try "manually" find the best score.- this is my way to learning new things, approaches I used many sources, I tried attach links to help the others and appreciate the authors of a given method.
